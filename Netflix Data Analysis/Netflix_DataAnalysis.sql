--1. Checking for Nulls in the dataset

SELECT
    COUNT(CASE WHEN show_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS showid_nulls,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN n.type IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS type_nulls,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN title IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS title_nulls,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN director IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS director_nulls,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN country IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS country_nulls,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN date_added IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS date_added_nulls,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN release_year IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS release_year_nulls,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN rating IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS rating_nulls,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN duration IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS duration_nulls,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN listed_in IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS listed_in_nulls
FROM [Netflix Data] n;
