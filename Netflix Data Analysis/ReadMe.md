# Project Title: Netflix Data Analysis ðŸŽ¥

In the Netflix Data Analysis project, I embarked on a comprehensive exploration of Netflix data. This involved data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks in SQL, followed by insightful analysis to uncover valuable findings. 
Throughout this project, I delved into various aspects of the Netflix dataset, extracting meaningful insights. Key highlights include identifying the distribution of content types on the platform, exploring the number of contents released by country, analyzing the yearly additions of content to the platform, understanding the distribution of different ratings given to titles, uncovering the oldest shows available, and identifying the top directors with the most content.

Using SQL, I created views that served as the foundation for visualization in PowerBI. Leveraging this powerful tool, I developed an informative and visually appealing dashboard. The dashboard offers a quick and comprehensive understanding of the analysis conducted above, providing insights into the diverse content landscape of Netflix.
