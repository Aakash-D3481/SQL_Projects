# Project Title: COVID-19 Data Analysis 🦠

I'm excited to share a significant milestone in my data analysis journey. Recently, I undertook an in-depth project focused on exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data. 

Throughout this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of the raw data, unearthing invaluable insights that shed light on the impact of the virus. Here are some notable highlights:

🔍 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐃𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐬: Through rigorous exploratory data analysis (EDA) in SQL, I examined the dataset, identifying the total number of cases and deaths. Furthermore, I calculated the death percentage to gain deeper insights into the severity of the virus.

🌍 𝐏𝐨𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬: By determining the percentage of total cases in relation to the global population, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the worldwide impact of COVID-19.

🌍 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞: By analyzing infection rates, I identified the countries experiencing the highest spread of the virus. This insight was crucial for understanding the areas requiring immediate attention.

🌍 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐃𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭: By examining the number of COVID-19-related deaths, I identified the countries with the highest fatality rates. This knowledge provided crucial insights for prioritizing healthcare resources.

🌍 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐃𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭 𝐛𝐲 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬: To understand the impact of the virus on a global scale, I analyzed the highest death counts by continents. This information helped identify regions requiring targeted interventions.

📈 𝐕𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐘𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬: By examining vaccination data across different countries and over the years, I gained insights into the progress of immunization efforts. This knowledge provided a comprehensive picture of the global response to the pandemic.

📈 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐬 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐛𝐲 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬: By analyzing the total number of tests conducted by countries, I obtained insights into testing strategies and trends. I explored the testing patterns over a three-year period, enabling a deeper understanding of testing dynamics across different regions.

🌍 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐎𝐕𝐈𝐃 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞: I identified countries with the highest COVID-19 positivity rates throughout the three-year period. This insight provided a comprehensive understanding of the regions facing the greatest challenges.

🌍 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐨𝐧 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧: By examining the total number of hospitalizations and calculating a hospitalization rate relative to the countries' populations, I gained insights into the strain on healthcare systems in different regions.

Using the views created in SQL, I developed an informative and visually appealing dashboard in PowerBI. The dashboard serves as a powerful tool for quick comprehension of the analysis performed above.

If you share a passion for data analysis, the study of pandemics, or if you're simply curious to learn more about my experience, I welcome you to connect with me. Let's exchange insights and explore the vast possibilities of data-driven decision-making together!

Stay tuned for more exciting projects and insights from my data analysis ventures. The future is bright, and I can't wait to share it with all of you! ✨📈
